# GO Playing Cards Application
> Udemy GoLang Course Mini-Project

This console-based application allows the user to create a new deck of cards, shuffle the deck using true random number generation, deal a hand of 5 random cards, save a list of cards to a file using XML and create a new deck from a previously saved deck.

This project was used to learn the use of variables, functions and return types, slices and loops, receiver functions, slice range syntax, multiple function return values, byte slices, error handling, random number generaton and finally testing!
